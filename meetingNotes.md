Notes

* Create database  
* Dashboard layout  
* Login  
  * Start local, maybe do online later  
  * Can disable the login  
* Login page  
* Aggregating Workouts  
* Backend Development – Database & Login System  
  * *Task*: Create a local database schema with foundational tables.  
    * Example: Tables for users, workouts, workout logs, journal entries, and user preferences.  
  * *Sub-task*: Implement a basic login system (PIN/password) that is optional but enables secure access to personal data.  
  * *Note*: This will be the primary backend work this week; focus on structure over functionality.  
* Frontend Development – Dashboard Layout & Login Page  
  * *Task*: Design and build a simple dashboard layout showing key health metrics (e.g., steps, heart rate, sleep).  
    * Focus: Visual structure only—no real-time data or interactivity yet.  
  * *Sub-task*: Develop the login page UI using Jetpack Compose.  
    * Ensure it aligns with the proposed design and user flow.  
* User Stories & Issue Tracking  
  * *Task*: Create five core user stories (to be added to the project board in GitHub) based on agreed-upon features:  
    * Create database schema  
    * Implement login page  
    * Design dashboard layout  
    * Aggregate workout routines with estimated durations (from sources like Wiki Muscle or MyFitnessPal)  
    * Begin mental health feature planning (e.g., guided breathing, mood journaling)  
  * *Note*: Each story will be assigned to a specific branch in GitHub for version control and team tracking.  
* Feature Exploration – External Data Sources  
  * *Task*: Research and gather workout routines with time estimates from:  
    * [Wiki Muscle](https://www.musclewiki.com/) (for guided workouts, muscle groups)  
    * MyFitnessPal or similar apps (to extract estimated durations per routine)  
  * *Note*: These will serve as demo content to populate the app later; no API integration required at this stage.  
* Team Roles & Communication  
  * *Assignment*:  
    * Jonathan: Backend – database setup and login system.  
    * Lynn / Michael: Frontend – dashboard layout and login page design/development.  
    * Alicia: Explore workout data sources (e.g., Wiki Muscle) to identify routines with time estimates.  
    * Grayson (Full-Stack): Act as liaison between front-end and back-end teams; ensure alignment on API calls, UI components, and data flow.  
* Development Process & Timeline  
  * *Approach*: "Skeletal" development first — build core structure before adding dynamic features.  
  * *Timeline*:  
    * Week 1: Complete database setup, login page, and dashboard layout.  
    * Week 2: Begin integrating workout data, mental health modules, and connect to campus events (e.g., Euler Gym hours via hardcoded data).  
* Design & Aesthetics  
  * *Note*: Open for future discussion — team will explore color schemes and branding as ideas evolve.  
  * *Initial Suggestion*: Consider hot pink or vibrant colors to reflect energy and wellness.  
* GitHub Workflow  
  * All user stories will be created as individual issues in the GitHub project board.  
  * Each feature will have its own branch for development, with pull requests planned for integration by the end of week 2\.
